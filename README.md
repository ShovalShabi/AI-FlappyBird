# AI-FlappyBird
A self-taught artificial intelligence bird that learns how to get never disqualified in the game Flappy Bird.
The AI engine is running the characters by rank and using the tanh function for rating, when the bird gets a rate over 0.5 of its own state as a result of tanh function it jumps otherwise it falls, as long the bird keeps going in the game it gets its rank higher and by that the Ai engine will breed other bird from it.

For understanding and commit to this project, you'll have to learn the basics concepts and theoretical knowledge of NEAT modules (basically the intelligence itself of the bird), some interaction with Pygame, and a spare of couple hours.
**There is a need to install the packages neat and pygame in the interpreter settings.**
Hope you enjoy it!!
