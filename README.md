# AI-FlappyBird
A self-taught artificial intelligence bird that learns how to get never disqualified in the game Flappy Bird.
For understanding and commit to this project, you'll have to learn the basics concepts and theoretical knowledge of Neat modules (basically the intelligence itself of the bird), some interaction with Pygame, and a spare of couple hours.
**There is a need to install the packages neat and pygame in the interpreter settings.**
Hope you enjoy it!!
